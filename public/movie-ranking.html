<h1>The Best Movies According to Michelle</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Footloose</h3>
<p>
Loved this movie when I was younger. <br />  
I was in boarding school and dancing was prohibited. <br />
We took the school on and used this movie as a reference, and the band was uplifted.
</p> 
<h3>Pritty Woman</h3>
<p>One of my favorites, from rags to richers.</p>
<h3>The Twilight Saga</h3>
<p>The is one of the most loved saga's.<br />
Each part of the move filled with suspense, keeping you on the lookout for the next part of the series.  Excellent, by far the best.</p>
